- 👩‍💻 Hi, I’m Hildah Nagawa, a beginner on a big journey 🌍
- 👀 I am an aspiring Business Analyst. I have dedicated countless hours to learning the basics of **Information Technology and Data Analytics**.
- 😒 Still amazed at how little I know after all that effort.

    **Welcome to my Github!**

 # MY JOURNEY 🌱
   I started learning IT with  **Harvards' CS50** and gradually progressed to other free online courses through **Cousera and Baobab.**
  -Got introduced to  **Data Analytics, SQL, Python, C, and Excel.**
  -I am not a pro yet  but definetly determined and pushing foward everyday.
  
 ## 🔧 My Current Skillset:
  **Python**: Basic Programming and Data Analysis
   **SQL**:   Basic queries and data manipulation (learning more every day).
   **Excel**: Data analysis, pivot tables, and charts.
  **Data Analytics**: I’ve built a foundation and now I’m ready to dive deeper.
  **Business Management**: I have a degree in International Business.

# 🚀 What’s Next:
- I’m looking to apply my growing skills in real-world projects—whether that’s through a **Duales Studium**, an internship, or a part-time job.
- I want to keep learning, building, and sharing my projects here. Every day is a step closer to my goal.
